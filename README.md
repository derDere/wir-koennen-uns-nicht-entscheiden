# Wir können uns nicht entscheiden

this project helps groups of people to decide what to do by fairly picking an option of a list created by the group in a way that is fair for every member of this group.

## Technologie
python venv pip flet.dev (web) requirements.txt

## Usage

- create a session
- get a session code
- send the session code to all members of the group
- or join a session via a code
- one the session is opened or once you joined a session the code is visible at the top right of the page
- after joining you will see a ui that allows you to add items to a list (string list)
- each member gets its own list
- once done you can press a ready button
- after pressing ready you see a waiting for other members screen
- once all members are done the view changes and displays a list made of all items of all other members
- you can now pick items that would be an option for you to. you can check all items or none.
- now we group all items based on what members would choose them.
   - **Example:**
      if the group of people is made of the members otto, max and steve then items will begrouped into the following item groups:
      - items accepted only by otto
      - items accepted only by max
      - items accepted only by steve
      - items accepted by otto and max
      - items accepted by otto and steve
      - items accepted by max and steve
      - items accepted by all
- after grouping all items empty groups will be removed
- now the random and fair selection will be made by first picking one of the item groups at random and then picking of the the items of that group at random.
- the random choise will be generated by picking a random number between list length times 10000 and list length times 90000 and then modulating that number by the list length.
  - **calculation:**
    rnd = randombetween(length * 10000, length * 90000)
    index = rnd mod length
- now the choosen item is shown to all the group members.
